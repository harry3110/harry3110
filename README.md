# Hi, I'm Harry 👋

I'm a full stack developer working with PHP on the backend and a few languages including the main frontend stack: HTML, CSS, JS. I love to design and create mostly websites and web applications but also small scripts and programs if I feel like it!

### 👨‍💻 Coding

I code in a few different languages, mainly PHP using the Symfony framework and also develop Wordpress plugin. But, I also code in Python, and JavaScript (Node, jQuery, etc.)


### 💻 Designing

As well as beening a developer I design and create web pages. If you wanted to view a few designs I've added some concept designs [here](concept/readme.md).


### ⭐ My favourite projects

- YouTube Downloader: I used to have slow internet so I made a YouTube downloader to download the latest videos from a number of set channels and add them to a local Plex server. Due to the amount of depencancies I'd like to redo the project at some point!

- Plex Discord Bot: Allows discord users to use their Plex server music in a voice channel.
