# Hi, I'm Harry 👋

I'm a full stack developer working with mainly PHP as the backend and a few languages for the frontend stack including HTML, CSS, JS. I love to design and create mostly websites and web applications but I also love to create small scripts and programs if I feel like it!


### 👨‍💻 Coding

I code in a few different languages, mainly PHP using the Symfony framework for bespoke applications or WordPress for plugins and themes. Recently, I have started to code more projects with JavaScript and Node, I would like to start learning TypeScript too. In the past, I have also coded in Python and Visual Basic for Application.


### 💻 Designing

As well as being a developer, I design and create website concepts. If you would like to view a few designs I've created, you can view them [here](https://github.com/harry3110/harry3110/blob/main/concepts/README.md).


### ⭐ My favourite projects

- YouTube Downloader: I used to have slow internet so I made a YouTube downloader to download the latest videos from a number of set channels and add them to a local Plex server. Due to the amount of depencancies I'd like to redo the project at some point!

- Plex Discord Bot: Allows discord users to use their Plex server music in a voice channel.

- WordPress Timeline: A shortcode to create a timeline that uses bootstrap for the design and a custom post type for the timeline items.
